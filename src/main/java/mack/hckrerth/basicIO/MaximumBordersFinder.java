 * You are given a table with n rows and m columns. Each cell is colored with white or black. Considering the shapes
 * created by black cells, what is the maximum border of these shapes? Border of a shape means the maximum number of
 * consecutive black cells in any row or column without any white cell in between. A shape is a set of connected
 * cells. Two cells are connected if they share an edge. Note that no shape has a hole in it.
